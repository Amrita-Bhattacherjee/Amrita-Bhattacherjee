I am currently a 2nd-year [MSc. Data Science](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/Vor-dem-Studium/Studiengaenge/Liste-Aktuelle-Studiengaenge/Studiengangbeschreibung/~pzpc/Data-Science-M-Sc/) student at [RWTH Aachen University, Germany](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1). I am specializing in the areas of Applied Machine Learning and Statistical Foundations of ML and AI. The focus areas of Computer Vision and Natural Language Understanding have highly intrigued me so far during my studies. Owing to the versatile and powerful applications of ML in every aspect of life, I lean towards an interdisciplinary approach of Applied ML.
